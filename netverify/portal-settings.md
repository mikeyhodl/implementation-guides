## Application Settings — General

### Callback, Error, and Success URLs

Define a **Callback URL** to automatically receive verification results and extracted user data from Jumio when a transaction is completed.

Define a **Success URL** to direct your customer after a successful user journey.

Define an **Error URL** to direct your customer when the verification process ends with an error or a failed submission attempt.


#### Required:

* HTTPS using the [TLS Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246) (most recent version recommended)
* Valid URL [(RFC-3986)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) using [ASCII characters](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046) or [IDNA Punycode](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492)

#### Forbidden:

* IP addresses, ports, certain query parameters used by Jumio, and fragment identifiers are not allowed.
* Personally identifiable information (PII) is not allowed in any form.
* Domains that do not belong to the customer (Using a callback URL that does not belong to the customer will expose PII data to an unknown endpoint. Using domains that do not belong to the customer will spam third party services which is not allowed by our policies.)

Jumio appends the following parameters to your Success or Error URL to redirect your user at the conclusion of the user journey. These cannot be used as part of your Success or Error URL:

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|transactionStatus| • `SUCCESS` for successful submissions. <br> • `ERROR`for errors and failure after 3 attempts.|
|customerInternalReference|Your internal reference for the transaction.|
|transactionReference|Jumio reference number for the transaction.|
|errorCode|Displayed when `transactionStatus` is `ERROR`.|


### Select Capture Method

Here you can specify how your user can submit an ID or Identity image for verification.<br>
<br>
Choose from:

- **Webcam and image upload**
- **Webcam only**
- **Image upload only**



|⚠️  Selecting "Webcam only" means some mobile browsers will not be supported.

### Colors

Specify primary and secondary colors for each locale to give ID Verification your own look and feel.

You can also reset all colors to the Jumio default.


### Images

Add a **Header image** for each locale to brand your ID Verification page.

Add a **Success image** and **Error image** for each locale to be displayed on the Jumio default success and error pages when you do not specify your own **successUrl** and **errorUrl**.

Any configuration which is not set will first default to the root language (e.g. EN\_GB to EN), then to your default setup, and finally to the Jumio default.

All images must be formatted as [JPG](https://jpeg.org/jpeg/) or [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) and must not exceed 5 MB.

The default includes all countries and ID types supported by Jumio at the time when your account was created.

### Data Retention
Select a time interval for permanent purge of sensitive data (360 days by default) or keep your data forever. The deletion of fraud transactions can be enabled (excluded by default).

If you update your data retention settings to a shorter span of time, records falling in the range of dates between your previous and new settings will be deleted automatically.

|⚠️  Data retention is calculated based on the transaction date (when a transaction has been created, not when the end-user started the user journey).<br><br>Be aware that the data retention will only apply for transactions in a final state. If the token lifetime is greater than the data retention period, the transaction will receive a final state when the token expired, afterwards the deletion will be triggered (e.g. data retention: 7 days, token lifetime: 14 days).

## Multi Documents

### Custom

You can create your own custom document types for Document Verification transactions. When submitting a new custom document type, it may take up to five minutes for your new custom document to appear in the Customer Portal.

Specify all three of the following:
* A unique document code (constraint: blanks are not allowed; max. length: 10 characters)
* A name
* A default label name in English

It is possible to add translations for different languages.

**Note:** The name and default label can be updated after creation. The document code cannot be changed. Custom document types can be disabled but not deleted, and the document code cannot be reused.
